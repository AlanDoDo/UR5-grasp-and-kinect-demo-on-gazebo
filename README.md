# UR5-grasp-and-kinect-demo-on-gazebo
This system is a simulation UR5 robot arm part grasping system based on ROS and gazebo, which can control the movement of the robot arm grasping block, inheriting the grasping plugin in gazebo. In addition, the system is also equipped with a kinect camera, which can identify obstacles and add them to planning scenarios to achieve obstacle avoidance planning
